## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and pnpm installed
- Python 3.7+ (for authentication server)

Before setting up Agent UI, you may want to have an Agno Playground running. If you haven't set up the Agno Playground yet, follow the [official guide](https://agno.link/agent-ui#connect-to-local-agents) to run the Playground locally.

### Quick Start

1. **Start the Authentication Server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   ./start_auth_server.sh
   ```

2. **Start the Web Application**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - Use invitation code: **JK23** (Lorenzo) or **JK46** (Simone)

For detailed setup instructions, see [AUTH_SETUP.md](./AUTH_SETUP.md).
